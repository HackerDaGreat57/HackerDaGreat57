I gave you unlimited love and support. I helped THREE of your damn alters, assisted with getting help, sacrificed HOURS of my precious time and was literally more available than your own girlfriend. I took up your interests, sacrificed a small part of my fucking manhood playing Genshin and what do I get? That giant fucking attitude of yours and this fixed mindset that you refuse to change. Not willing to try anything new. Not willing to do anything that sounds remotely like improving your own fucking life. This mental disorder bullshit is starting to look faker and faker every motherfucking day. I refuse to believe someone can have THAT much trouble asking their parents for help. I’m done. Burn in your hellhole.

And I’m not pressuring you if it’s such an essential thing. I fail to understand how someone with a so called mental disorder can live their life so normally without even telling their fucking parents. All ur “alters” are either really smart or you’re one of the best actors that ever lived. Or I dunno, maybe they were actually able to live their fucking lives because I was there for them when they formed.

You know why I stuck with you for that long anyway? Because I couldn’t help falling in love. Every time I talked to you I smiled. We had chemistry. We texted for hours at night. You made my world feel *alive* and *hopeful* for once. It’s all gone now. I’m back in fucking square 1. Back to being a hopeless introverted teenage boy that browses Reddit and brags about being a fucking Discord mod in front of the entire class.

By the way, about ur little “girlfriend”. If you wanna make that work then stop being such a bitch or she’ll leave you with an even angrier note than this one. She’s been avoiding you because you’re way too easy to piss off. And I doubt she even cares. Even I cared more than her, for fuck’s sake.
