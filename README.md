I just mess around with Unreal Engine 5 and Blender 3. I'm planning to get an M-series powered Mac (the generation that comes after the M1 Max), so that's when I'll start writing real code. Until then, however, I will have to do my hobbies on this steaming black plastic box with a red keyboard. Guess which company it's made by. (It's right hinge is broken, ring a bell?)

I'm also learning Java 17. â˜• Doesn't hurt to learn more information (that potentially be a lifesaver)!
