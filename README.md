Currently, C++ on Windows is my jam - I'm the guy behind [CarbonCoffee](https://github.com/carcof). Ignore any virus warnings from my software/websites! All of them are false positives ðŸ˜‰. Also, most of my stuff is on SVN (to work around file size limits), so the GitHub repositories are only for Issues and Discussions + a few more Git-specific things. (look down for SVN details â†“)

My SVN repository hub is [here](https://Public:a@e13c-2601-647-6300-6380-e825-ba3a-4ef-b41f.ngrok.io)! Credentials for my SVN repos are the same for the general public; Username is "**Public"**, and Password is **"a"**). Don't worry, it's a completely safe URL, it's just that I'm using the free version of [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) so the links are a tad lengthy.
