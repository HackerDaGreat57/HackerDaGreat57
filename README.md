Howdy. (I live in California which is technically the West 🙃)

- 🔭 I wonder if aliens exist... 🤔
- 📖 I am reading [How Computers Work: The Evolution of Technology](https://www.amazon.com/How-Computers-Work-Evolution-Technology/dp/078974984X).
- 🌱 With the knowledge I acquire from the book mentioned above and a few others, I will attempt building my own CPU emulator.
- 📝 I'm currently working on [a handy build helper for GCC](https://github.com/HackerDaGreat57/trinkets)
- 💬 I'd love to chat, but unfortunately I barely have time for anything these days...
- 📫 How to reach me: `HackerDaGreat57@gmail.com` or `HackerDaGreat57#2046` on Discord
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him
- 🦠 Help scientists fight disastrous diseases by [folding@home](https://foldingathome.org/). [Here's my profile](https://stats.foldingathome.org/donor/name/HackerDaGreat57).
- ⚡ Fun (actually pretty sad) fact: I don't get any allowance 😔

I know a *bit* of Batchfile, Shell script, Python, and Java. Although I am somewhat familiar with C/C++, I'm not (yet) what you'd call a developer who knows *exactly* what he's doing. LOL

  <summary>My bucket list</summary>

- [X] **Done (2013):** Use a computer for the first time and think about how the experience just hit different (this is when I got my "spark" 😉)
- [X] **Done (2017):** Get my first computer and learn the bare basics of Scratch & Python (in 2013-2017 I just unproductively played clickbait mobile games on an iPad 2 all day)
- [X] **Done (2020):** Fool around with C++/Win32 and get a taste for low-level programming (most of my C++ experience originates in this period)
- [X] **Done (2022):** Make the switch to Linux and learn to not depend on GUIs for everything - none of my home computers run Windows as of January 2023
- [ ] **In progress:** Make a user-friendly build script for GCC that makes the process of building it so much easier
- [ ] **Pending:** Design & finish the Hex-Zip File Compression Program (details coming soon)
- [ ] **Pending:** Create a version control system like Git based on Hex-Zip. If Torvalds can do it in a week then I can do it in a year! (Or maybe much much longer than that)
- [ ] **Pending:** Design server software for my VCS that people can use to selfhost their own GitHub-like website easily and painlessly
- [ ] **Pending:** Make a file system that uses Hex-Zip compression to maximize the usable storage space of every disk it's formatted with (my operating system will use this filesystem by default)
- [ ] **Pending:** Get started on building the Three-Dimensional Operating System. First plan everything and learn more about assembly and computer architectures before starting if necessary.
- [ ] **Pending, probably never will complete:** Find a way to convert matter into electrical energy and precisely manipulate matter to solve all of humanity's problems - figure out teleportation while you're at it
