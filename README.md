Currently, C++ on Windows is my jam - I make [CarbonCoffee](https://github.com/HackerDaGreat57/CarbonCoffee). I'm a white hat ðŸ¤  ignore any virus warnings from my software/websites! All of them are false positives ðŸ˜‰. Also, most of my stuff is on SVN, so projects made after 1/12/2022 all get created there. (look down â†“)

My SVN repository hub is [here](https://cb48-2601-647-6300-6380-d808-ffc1-dc63-7646.ngrok.io/). Credentials for my SVN repos are the same for the general public; Username is "**Public"**, and Password is **"a"**). If you don't want to click that link, you can take a look at its desciption below.  

**[UnrealAssets](https://cb48-2601-647-6300-6380-d808-ffc1-dc63-7646.ngrok.io/svn/UnrealAssets/)**: A collection of assets for Unreal Engine 5. It's basically a copy of Quixel's library, plus my own little assets - I have licensed them as MIT. Enjoy ðŸ˜‰

**[CarbonCoffee](https://cb48-2601-647-6300-6380-d808-ffc1-dc63-7646.ngrok.io/svn/CarbonCoffee/)**: An app which I have decided to migrate to the Mac platform. Its development will be resumed when I get a physial Mac (VMs are a little "eh" ðŸ˜¬)  

**[PizzaOS](https://cb48-2601-647-6300-6380-d808-ffc1-dc63-7646.ngrok.io/svn/PizzaOS/)**: A toy OS which I made from [a tutorial](https://github.com/gmarino2048/64bit-os-tutorial). It is infected with terrible, unfixable bugs, so I only keep it for history's sake ðŸ˜…
