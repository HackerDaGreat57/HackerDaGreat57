Currently, C++ on Windows is my jam - I make [CarbonCoffee](https://github.com/HackerDaGreat57/CarbonCoffee). Ignore any virus warnings from my software/websites! All of them are false positives ðŸ˜‰. Also, most of my stuff is on SVN, so the GitHub repositories are only for Issues and Discussions + a few more Git-specific things. (look down for SVN details â†“)

My SVN repository hub is [here](https://e62f-2601-647-6300-6380-c902-ee1d-fc6a-80fc.ngrok.io)! Credentials for my SVN repos are the same for the general public; Username is "**Public"**, and Password is **"a"**). If you don't want to click that link, you can take a look at its desciption below.  

**[CarbonCoffee](https://e62f-2601-647-6300-6380-c902-ee1d-fc6a-80fc.ngrok.io/svn/CarbonCoffee/)**: An app which is just a crazy experiment that will never be truly finished. **TL;DR:** Something that bundles my own software all into one package. 

**[PizzaOS](https://e62f-2601-647-6300-6380-c902-ee1d-fc6a-80fc.ngrok.io/svn/PizzaOS/)**: A toy OS which I made from [a tutorial](https://github.com/gmarino2048/64bit-os-tutorial). It is infected with terrible, unfixable bugs, so I only keep it for history's sake ðŸ˜…
