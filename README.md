Howdy.

- 🔭 I wonder if aliens exist... 🤔
- **🇮🇳** I came from India to the USA just a few years after I was born. I still love my home country but I hate what people are doing to the air there 😮‍💨
- 🌱 I recently learned [it&#39;s possible to host your own Codespace](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/tunnels) for free. I use it on a relatively feeble Raspberry Pi and it's great, apart from slight 1/6 second terminal input lag. All of my extensions and settings work perfectly, except I can't use a code font other than the default one, but I don't mind it that much.
- 📝 I'm currently working on [my own licenses](https://github.com/HackerDaGreat57/3dOS-License-Suite "Click here to view this project!") for assets that will be included in my future projects
- 💬 I'd love to chat, but unfortunately I barely have time for anything these days...
- 📫 How to reach me: `HackerDaGreat57@gmail.com` or `HackerDaGreat57#2046` on Discord
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him
- 🧐 One Reddit post I found interesting today is [this man who refuses to SIT DOWN](https://www.reddit.com/r/Whatcouldgowrong/comments/10ib1j8/wcgw_not_sitting_down_properly/)
- ⚡ Fun (actually pretty sad) fact: I don't get any allowance 😔

I know a *bit* of Batchfile, Shell script, Python, and Java. Although I am somewhat familiar with C/C++, I'm not (yet) what you'd call a developer who knows *exactly* what he's doing. LOL

  <summary>My bucket list</summary>

- [X] **Done (2013):** Use a computer for the first time and think about how the experience just hit different (this is when I got my "spark" 😉)
- [X] **Done (2017):** Get my first computer and learn the bare basics of Scratch & Python (in 2013-2017 I just unproductively played clickbait mobile games on an iPad 2 all day)
- [X] **Done (2020):** Fool around with C++/Win32 and get a taste for low-level programming (most of my C++ experience originates in this period)
- [X] **Done (2022):** Make the switch to Linux and learn to not depend on GUIs for everything - none of my home computers run Windows as of January 2023
- [ ] **[In progress](https://github.com/HackerDaGreat57/3dOS-License-Suite "Click here to look at this!"):** Make my own asset licenses so people can't use my work for purposes I'm against (like the GNU Philosophies except I also don't like people selling it)
- [ ] **Pending:** Design & finish the Hex-Zip File Compression Program (details coming soon)
- [ ] **Pending:** Create a version control system like Git based on Hex-Zip. If Torvalds can do it in a week then I can do it in a year! (Or maybe much much longer than that)
- [ ] **Pending:** Design server software for my VCS that people can use to selfhost their own GitHub-like website easily and painlessly
- [ ] **Pending:** Make a file system that uses Hex-Zip compression to maximize the usable storage space of every disk it's formatted with (my operating system will use this filesystem by default)
- [ ] **Pending:** Get started on building the Three-Dimensional Operating System. First plan everything and learn more about assembly and computer architectures before starting if necessary.
