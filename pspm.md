## Mercury

5/15/2023

  Dear Somebody,

    My time here at Planet Mercury has certainly been less than pleasurable. It's way too hot for me to take off my space suit, first of all; the temperature is nearly 430°C. Not to mention how long the days are. Gravity is a lot less intense here, so it is kind of fun to jump around and get that feeling of flight and freedom, but that's limited by the fact that I can't jump too high or I will drift off into space, not to mention how hard it is to move in the thermal suit. And when it's nighttime, it's -180°C; these heavy temperature differences are because of the fact that the atmosphere is extremely thin. Continue your nice day in your comfy little blue paradise.

## Venus

5/15/2023

    Dear Somebody,

    My time here on Planet Venus has been quite interesting. The planet which looks like it has a yellow lightning strike stretching across it is actually as hot as it looks. In fact, it's the hottest planet in the Solar System. It has a thick, toxic atmosphere and always has a runaway greenhouse effect. Gravity is less intense than Earth, but that doesn't mean I can wander beyond the safety of my pod and frolick in the landscape outside. There are literally clouds of sulfuric acid outside! Enjoy your floating white puffs of water. See you soon.

## Earth

5/16/2023

    Dear Alien,

    My time here on Planet Earth has been quite pleasurable. I've been living my whole life here on this cool planet full of mostly oceans and vegetation. This planet is in the "goldilocks zone", which means that its distance from the Sun is just right for living conditions to be perfect for humans. It also has an atmosphere composed of enough oxygen for me to not need a gas mask. The conditions are OK enough for me to not need any special equipment, actually. The wide array of wildlife and edible vegetation here also mean that I don't need to worry about packing food all that much.

## Mars

5/16/2023

    Dear Somebody,

    My time here on Mars has been quite interesting. My eyes are tired of seeing the color red. I miss the greenery of Earth. Otherwise, this planet is very similar similar to Earth: it has seasons, weather, polar ice caps, and geographic features like canyons. It also has a very thin atmosphere made of carbon dioxide, so the difference in temperature between day and night is very noticeable and I need to wear an oxygen mask when outdoors. There are no oceans, lakes, or rivers; I only occasionally see icy dirt and thin clouds sometimes.

## Jupiter

5/17/2023

    Dear Somebody,

    My time here on Jupiter has been harrowing. I weigh way too much here; it's impossible to stand up, let alone walk. The storms outside make it pointless to even take a look out the window of my pod. This whole planet is just really weird in general. Swirls of gas everywhere, no visibility, it's made entirely of gas, and it's almost big enough to be star, but it isn't. It's boring, honestly. The intense storms and high wind temperatures are interesting at first but get dull after a while. The biggest planet in the Solar System is quite literally a bunch of hot gas.

## Saturn

5/17/2023

    Dear Somebody,

    My time here on Saturn has been boring but strangely similar to Earth. I weigh only slightly more, but that's about it. Nothing but blue swirls of gas, somewhat like Jupiter. I can't actually stand on it since it's a gas giant. The rings aren't solid of course, they're mostly composed of bits of ice and rock that orbit the planet because of gravity. Saturn actually has more moons than any other planet in the Solar System, and one of them is bigger than Mercury. But I think moon exploration is for another day.

## Uranus

5/17/2023

    Dear Somebody,

    Uranus is a unique planet. It's an ice giant, which means it has icy materials flowing on top of a solid core. It's very weird, really, it's like hail but sideways. This planet also has rings, but they're so thin they're really hard to notice with the naked eye because they absorb a lot of light from the Sun and don't reflect a lot of it back. It also has 27 moons! Uranus is as big as 63 Earths, but is one of the lest dense planets in the Solar System. It has a tiny solid core, and then a bunch of fluids floating around on top of it. Honestly it's beautiful to look at but not very functional.

## Neptune

5/18/2023

    Dear Somebody,

    Neptune is a planet that's very similar to Uranus; they share many of the same characteristics and they are both blue. However, Neptune is significantly farther away from the Sun than Uranus. Even though that distance is more than 30 times than that of Earth, it is still kept in the Solar System by the gravitational field of the Sun! Also, although it's much farther away from the Sun than Uranus, it's not the coldest planet in the Solar System. Uranus is still the coldest. Neptune's surface is made of a thick soup of water, ammonia, and methane. Speaking of soup, I'm getting hungry.
